This is a bakery cafe website.

1. I have created a navigation menu that expands & reduces to accommodate different device sizes – mobile to desktop. I used a media query to accomplish this.
2. I used media queries and Flexbox CSS to organize my content which allows it to adapt to different devices. It causes my content to flip or swap places, then finally to reduce to a single column when I size the page to mobile.

3. I used JavaScript to control the hamburger icon. This causes it to show or hide the navigation items - “Home”, “Menu”, “About”, and “Contact”.

The following are my JavaScript features:

1. I calculated and displayed the store offer based on the current date - I use that in the discount offer that expires seven days from the current date.

2. I Created a month and day array and use these to populate and calulate the store offer days and dates.

3. I show Louisville weather conditions by using the AccuWeather API. This is inserted into the webpage's main image.

4. I used regex to validate and correctly display form name, email and telephone inputs. I use bootstrap tool tips as form field guides and alerts if fields are entered correctly or not.

5. I used a JavaScript array to populate the initial food menu section - “Sweet Treats”, on the web page.
